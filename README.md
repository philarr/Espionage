Comet, http server push, old stuff.

Isometric game library I wrote to experiment with HTTP streaming back in 2009. Uses a perl library called Meteor (not related to the meteor framework) to handle long-held connections.
1px iframe to open connection was the default with fallback to long-polling and periodical polling as a last resort.
